## This is the repository for my backend class and project in CoderHouse Academy

An ecommerce project I developed for my backen course in CoderHouse. This is actually my friend's side business, which you can follow [here](https://www.instagram.com/ringo.orfebreria/?hl=es).

I made it a FullStack project to practice, so it is actually a MERN Stack ecommerce.

### Clone it from GitHub :hammer_and_wrench:

\_
git init
git clone https://github.com/sofifernandez/desafiosBackendCoder/tree/main/proyectoEcommerce_MERN
npm run cargarDatos #first time only to upload data
npm run server
